# Game_AnyKeyArena
A text based game where you can play with the press of a key...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple text based game I made in C#. The program uses a simple user input of the "any-key" and works with a randomizer alghorithme.
The code is set-up that it itterates through the pre-set amount of itterations before being confronted with the final enemy. The program is still
a bit faulty, but it manages to do most of it quite well. 

Mind you that the comments written in the codefile is in Dutch...
